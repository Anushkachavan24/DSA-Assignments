Implement ADT Binary Search Tree using a linked list of nodes of structure having MIS,
Name, left pointer, right pointer, and parent pointers pointing to left sub-trees, right sub tree
and parent of the node respectively. The BST is organized by the MIS number.
Write following functions:
initBST() // to initialize the tree.
insertNode() // recursive function to add a new node to the tree.
removeNode() // to remove a node from a tree.
search() // to recursively search for a node with the given key.
postorder() // write a non-recursive function for post order traversal.
Display_Level() // to display all nodes of ith level.
destroyTree() // to delete all nodes of a tree
Write a menu driven program to invoke all above functions.
